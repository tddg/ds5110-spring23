# Tutorial about Setting Up an AWS-EC2-hosted Jupyter Notebook Service

There are two ways of writing/editing PySpark programs on a remote
cloud server:
* Use a shell text editor of your choice (e.g., VIM, nano, Emacs, etc.).
* Launch a Jupyter Notebook and directly write PySpark code there.

This tutorial is provided in case you need to use 
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
for Assignment 1, though you can complete the assignment without it.


## Step 0: Install Pip

First, install `pip3` (the [package installer for Python](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)).

```sh
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y python3-pip
$ which pip3
```

The third command above, `which pip3`, should output something like
`/usr/bin/pip3` if it's successfully installed.

`pip3` by default will install everything in `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin` on
your EC2 instance. This path, however, is not included by the
environment variable `$PATH`, so your shell will not be able to
locate the installed programs through `pip3`. To fix this, you will
need to include the path in `$PATH` by running the following command:

```sh
$ source ~/.profile
```


## Step 1: Install Jupyter Notebook

To install Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
$ pip3 install notebook
```


## Step 2: Install findspark library

```sh
$ pip3 install findspark
```

This is used to help your Jupyter Notebook find the Spark directory.


## Step 3: Configure JAVA_HOME 

Add `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre` to your
`/home/ubuntu/.bashrc` file:

```sh
$ echo 'export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

This is so that your PySpark code running inside of a Jupyter
Notebook session can find the corresponding Spark Java/Scala runtime.


## Step 4: Deploy a Jupyter Notebook server

SSH into your EC2 instance where you've just installed the Jupyter
Notebook (say the scheduler instance `vm1`) using the following
command:

```sh
$ ssh -i "vockey.pem" ubuntu@<public_IPv4_DNS_address_of_your_EC2_instance> -L 8000:localhost:8888
```

The `-L` option is to forward any connections to the given TCP port
`8000` on your local client host to the given remote
host (the specified EC2 instance of `<public_IPv4_DNS_address_of_your_EC2_instance>`)
and port (`8888`), or Unix socket, on the remote side.

Once SSH'ed in, start the Jupyter Notebook server process using command
`jupyter notebook`. You will see some output information generated
by the launched Notebook server process:

```
To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
    file:///home/ubuntu/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-3233-open.html
Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
    http://localhost:8888/?token=557f06135dd4c77bc5267c88abca55db1672f741ff7631a4
 or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=557f06135dd4c77bc5267c88abca55db1672f741ff7631a4
```

On your local client machine, open a web browser and go to
`localhost:8000` and copy paste the token when it prompts. Now you
can start writing Python code using your Notebook GUI from your
browser.



## Step 5: Work on PySpark programming using your cloud-hosted Notebook


Before importing `pyspark` in your Notebook session, **you should first
import `findspark` and use it to locate to the Spark directory**:

```py
import findspark
findspark.init('/home/ubuntu/spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3')
```

Then you can import the PySpark package and start working on the assignment
using Jupyter Notebook.

In the snapshot above, the blurred Spark URL under `.master()` should
be the private IP address of your Spark Master node.

Hope this helps!
