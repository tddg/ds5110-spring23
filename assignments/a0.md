## Overview

You will do all your assignments for DS 5110 using [AWS
Academy](https://www.awsacademy.com/vforcesite/LMS_Login).
Through AWS Academy, you can get access to a wide range of computing,
storage, and network resources on [Amazon Web
Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS). If you haven't worked with
AWS Academy before, you need to go through the AWS Academcy
onboarding process. 

This assignment will walk you through the AWS Academy registration
process and show you how to use AWS from AWS Academy. 



## Learning outcomes

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Create and SSH into an EC2 virtual machine instance.



## Register an AWS Academy account

You will receive a course invitation email sent to your `virginia.edu` email. 
You will need to register with AWS Academy Canvas (note this is different from UVA Canvas) before you can participate in the AWS Academy Learner Lab. 
To register, click on `Get Started` in the invitation email. It will bring you to the `Welcome Aboard` web page. Enter a password under your email, select `Eastern Time (US & Canada)` as the Time Zone, and click on `Register`. 

After successfully registered, you will have access to the your AWS Academy portal. You will see the AWS Academy Learner Lab under `Dashboard`. Click on `Accept` to accept the invitation to join AWS Academy Learner Lab if you see a message at the very top of the web page. 

Click on AWS Academy Learner Lab at the Dashboard to enter. Then
click on `Modules` to view the available modules. If you are
unfamiliar with how to use AWS Academy, we recommend taking a look at
the `Student Guide.pdf` document under `Modules`. The `Student Guide`
also introduces how to start a lab and how to use the available AWS
services. 

To start using the AWS resources, click on `Learner Lab` under
`Module`, which will bring you to the Terms and Conditions. Click on
`I agree` and enter the lab session. 

![AWS Academy Setting]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/aws_academy_dash0.png)

The lab session is a web terminal interface with limited
functionality. To start the lab, click on `Start Lab` at the top of
the web terminal interface. The starting process should take a few
minutes (if this is the very first time you start the lab, as in the
background AWS Academy creates a temporary AWS account for you under
the Learner Lab). At the same time, you can see your available AWS
cloud credit with a total amount of $100 and how much you have used.
When the signal light at the top left corner turns green, it
indicates the lab has started. 

![AWS Academy Setting]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/aws_academy_dash1.png)

Click on the green signal light to access your AWS Console Home web
page. 

A started lab session has a session duration of up to 
four hours (see the timer `04:00` in the figure above). When the lab
session timer runs to `0:00`, the session will automatically end, but
any data and resources that you created in the AWS account will be
retained. If you later launch a new session (for example, the next
day), you will find that your work is still in the lab environment.
Running EC2 instances will be stopped and then automatically
restarted the next time you start a session. 

> **IMPORTANT:** Monitor your lab budget in the lab interface above. 
Whenever you have an active lab session, the latest known remaining
budget information will display at the top of this screen. This data
comes from AWS Budgets which typically updates every 8 to 12 hours.
Therefore the remaining budget that you see may not reflect your most
recent account activity.  **If you exceed your lab budget your lab
account will be disabled and all progress and resources will be lost.**
As a best practice, we **highly recommend** frequently pushing your
progress to online repositories such as [GitHub](https://github.com/)
to avoid losing data. Therefore, it is important for you to manage
your spending. When you use GitHub or any other online repository service,
make sure to create a **private** repository; **DO NOT** share any of 
your code to other students and the internet.

At the AWS Console Home page, click on `Services` at the top left
corner and click on `Compute` to view all the available computing
services that you may use. Click on `EC2` to start creating new EC2
VM (virtual machine) instances. 


## Create and access EC2 instances

### Step 1: Create a name and choose an OS image for your VM
Under `EC2`, click on `Launch instances` to start creating a new VM.
Type a name to label your VM under `Name and tags`. For example, name
your first instance `vm0`.

We recommend using Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS as the OS image and
`64-bit (x86)` as the architecture. You have limited options of
instance types to choose from. You can also specify the number of
instances to launch at this time. To start off, choose 1. Later for
[Assignment 1](/ds5110-spring23/assignments/a1) choose 2 and for
[Assignment 2](/ds5110-spring23/assignments/a2) choose 5.

### Step 2: Choose an OS image
Next choose an EC2 instance type.  To test, you can always create one
or multiple `t2.micro` or `t1.micro`, both of which are free tier
eligible, meaning the resource is free of charge. 
There are, however, a limited range of EC2 instances that you can
choose from. We recommend using the `t3.large` instance type that comes
with 2 vCPU cores and 8 GB of memory.

![EC2 instances]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/ec2_create_vm1.png)

### Step 3: Choose an SSH key pair
What is important when creating new VMs is that you choose a key pair
for SSH login. Under `Key pair (login)`, click on the drop down menu
and select `vockey (type rsa)`. 

![EC2 instances]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/ec2_create_vm2.png)

### Step 4: Check HTTP/HTTPS options
Under `Network settings`, you may check `Allow HTTPs traffic from the
internet` and `Allow HTTP traffic from the internet` so that you can
access the web servers hosted on your EC2 VM. (Apache Spark comes
with a web-based dash, and would require HTTP/HTTPS traffic.) 

![EC2 instances]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/ec2_create_vm3.png)

### Step 5: Configure storage
You may also increase the storage capacity of the `Root volume` under
`Configure storage`. By default you will be allocated a small 8-GB
root disk. We recommend increasing it to 100 GB so that you have
sufficient disk storage capacity for dependency installation and
storing datasets. Optionally, you can also add a new EBS volume of
100GB just in case the 100GB root volume runs out of capacity (it
runs out of space very fast considering the installation of quite a
few large software packages and datasets).

### Step 6: Configure the subnet availability zone
We recommend launching all your EC2 instances in the same
availability zone. Any US east zones should be fine. This can be
configured in Network settings. Once choosing one, always stick with
it when creating new EC2 instances. This is to guarantee the best
network performance among your EC2 instances.
For example, you may choose to use a subnet within an availability
zone of `us-east-1a` and stick with it.

![EC2 instances]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/ec2_create_vm5.png)

### Step 7: Launch the EC2 instance
After finalizing the EC2 VM configuration, click on the `Launch
instance` button on the right side to launch the configured VM. It
may take a few minutes to start the VM. 

### Step 8: Download the SSH private key
Now go back to the Learner Lab web page. This is where you can
download the SSH key. Click on the `AWS Details` tab, you will see
the information you need to login to your computing resources. Under
`SSH key`, click on `Download PEM` to download the SSH key to your
local computer. It comes with a default name of `labsuser.pem`.

![AWS Academy Setting]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/aws_academy_ssh_key.png)

### Step 9: Login to the EC2 instance through SSH
Open a terminal (if you use a MacBook, open the `Terminal` software),
locate your private key file that you have just downloaded locally,
change its name to `vockey.pem` and update its permission, if
necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable:

```bash
% mv labsuser.pem vockey.pem
% chmod 400 vockey.pem
```

Then, connect to your instance using the following command:

```bash
% ssh -i "vockey.pem" ubuntu@[public_IPv4_DNS_address_of_your_EC2_instance]
``` 

To view the connection instruction, click on the instance ID from your AWS Console, then click on `Connect` at the top right corner of the page to view the public DNS address of your EC2 instance. An example instance name looks something like this: `ubuntu@ec2-11-222-3-190.compute-1.amazonaws.com`, where `ubuntu` is your default username under that instance.
