# DS 5110 Project

## Deadlines

0. ~~Friday, 02/24, 11:00 am: Project bidding~~


1. Friday, 03/24, 11:00 am: Project checkpoint 1

	* Proposal phase: report any preliminary results that you have.

2. Friday, 04/14, 11:00 am: Project checkpoint 2

	* For system/tool building projects, you are expected to show prototypes.
	* For data analysis projects, you are expected to show general statistics of your datasets and concrete examples or case studies.


3. Friday, 05/03, 11:00 am: Project everything due

	* For system/tool building project, you are expected to show primary results.
	* For measurement/study projects, you are expected to show your numbers and findings.



## Reports and Artifacts (code, datasets, etc.)

### Checkpoint #1: Proposal

Recommended structure for the checkpoint proposal report is:

* Title.
* Motivation + concrete problem statement (need not be formal, only concrete).
* Approaches/system_design/experiment_design proposed / planned to solve the aforementioned
problems: Initial thoughts + what you have done in design/setups/experimental_tests.
* Timeline/Expected milestones for achieving your goals.
* Any preliminary results that you have collected so far if any.

Your checkpoint report should describe your progress on achieving the
goals you included in your proposal. Clearly explain any changes you
have made to the goal of your project based on your experience so
far. Also, provide a concrete plan of what you will need to
accomplish in the remaining weeks to complete your project. It's OK
to report any preliminary results that you have already collected if any.

Your checkpoint #1 report should use a shared Google Doc.

About 1-2 pages is fine.
The end product of the proposal is a crisp **problem statement**. Please
submit your report via a shared Google Doc in Canvas (so we can comment on
specific lines).



### Checkpoint #2: Primary results

Similar as Checkpoint #1. What's more, you must include primary
results (e.g., small-scale measurement results, examples that your
prototype can already handle, etc). Please format your checkpoint #2
report as a PDF file in Canvas.
Please format your checkpoint #2 report using the [this
template](https://github.com/tddg/ds5110_latex_template);
submissions formatted with other templates are invalid. An example PDF can be found
[here](https://github.com/tddg/ds5110_latex_template/blob/main/paper.pdf).

More conveniently, I highly recommend using hosted Latex service such
as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for collaborative latex
editing with your teammates. 

UVA is providing [Overleaf professional
features](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/virginia) for all students,
faculty, and staff. 

Overleaf is designed to make the process of writing, editing and
producing your research papers and project reports much quicker for
both you and your collaborators. Overleaf can also be linked to other
services to best fit into your workflow.

**Give it a try if you have not used Latex/Overleaf
before!**



### Final report

Your final report should be written like **a conference-quality paper**
that you read in class.
Following are some example questions that may help you organize your storyline:

* Question 0: What is/are your **main hypothesis/hypotheses** in the project? This is a one-sentence summary of your paper. Position your paper w.r.t. other related work on the same or even similar problems (reuse relevant parts of your survey report here!). Show to the reader that your work is on a unique point in the design spectrum. Don't overstate it, don't understate it either. This statement is related to Question 5 below (yes, it's a chicken and egg problem!)
* Question 1: What are your **goals**?
* Question 2: What is your **design and implementation** (for system/tool building)?
* Question 3: What are your research questions (for data analysis)?
* Question 4: What do your approaches **gain and lose** you? That is, what are the tradeoffs, if any?
* Question 5: What do your **results** tell you? (This is related to Question 0, 3, 4 above, and again, it's an egg and chicken problem!) Show that your data supports your hypothesis, and show the gains, losses, and tradeoffs by using your techniques/analysis/measurements.

As well as pay attention to:

* Importance of problem,
* Novelty of solution,
* Evaluation of solution,
* Clarity of Presentation,
* Nits (grammar, references, etc.).

Your paper must be **no longer than 6 pages and no shorter than 4 pages**. The paper
can have as many additional pages for references and for supplemental material
in appendices.
Please format your paper using the [this
template](https://github.com/tddg/ds5110_latex_template);
submissions formatted with other templates are invalid.
