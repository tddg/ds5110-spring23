# DS5110: Big Data Systems

Welcome to the graduate course on Big Data Systems.  Scalable big
data systems are a central part of modern data science.  This course
will cover topics including design and use of parallel dataflow
systems (MapReduce/Hadoop and Spark), scalable and parallel Python
analytics frameworks, cloud data systems (cloud storage, cloud-native
data processing), and machine learning systems. A major component of
this course is hands-on programming using scalable analytics tools
and cloud resources such as Google Cloud and Azure Cloud.
