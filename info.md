## Reading

There are no official textbooks. Required readings are (most
frequently) in the form of seminal [research papers](./reading_list.html) and/or selected
textbook chapters
There are several books that *might* be useful. Good thing is they are completely free:

* [Distributed Systems 3rd edition
(2017)](https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/ds3/),
by Maarten van Steen and Andrew S. Tenenbaum (suggested optional
readings will most frequently be drawn from this book).

* [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/), by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Aug, 2018 (v 1.00).


I also strongly encourage you to discuss the assigned/optional
readings (papers/tech reports/online documents) with other students
in the class â€” you may have insights that others do not, and vice
versa.  Oftentimes, students form reading groups, which I encourage;
on the other hand, I would like to point out that group discussion is
**not an effective substitute for actually reading the paper**.


## Class participation

In addition to lectures, we will use a discuss-orientede format.
Class participation is required. We will discuss the design and the
use (application) of a variety of modern big data systems that we'll
cover during this semester.  Most of these systems have research
papers, if not, online docs, which present the original/evolved
design of them. One of the many great examples is Google's MapReduce
(and later the open-source implementation of MapReduce: Apache
Hadoop), which opens a new era of what we call **Big Data
Systems** today.

Specifically, the instructor (prof or the invited guest speaker) will
lead the lecture. In some lectures we will have moderate
discussions about the papers/articles that we will have all read
before each class. For lectures that have a required reading
assignment, I will provide you with a short review form that you must
complete and submit before the class. The teaching staff (prof and the
GTA) will go through your reviews the night before the class and
answer questions that you may have in your reviews. You are
encouraged to participate in discussions as your performance in class
forms up to 5% of your overall grade, so it does matter that you 1)
show up to class **AND** 2) participate in the discussion (which in
fact requires you to do the required readings).



## Programming assignments

We will have three Programming Assignments during the first half of the
semester.


### Assignment sketches

* [Assignment 0](/DS5110-Spring-2023/assignments/a0): Using AWS Academy and AWS EC2.
* [Assignment 1](/DS5110-Spring-2023/assignments/a1): A tour of Apache HDFS and Spark.
* [Assignment 2](/DS5110-Spring-2023/assignments/a2): Dask.distributed analytics.



## Course projects

Probably the most exciting part of this course is to complete an
interesting project related to big data systems.  I will provide you
with a list of ideas around Week 5/6.



## Grading policy

Your grade will be calculated as follows:

* 10% midterm exams
* 5%  in-class participation
* 5%  reading review forms
* 5%  quizzes
* 5%  assignment 0
* 10% assignment 1
* 10% assignment 2
* 10% project proposal
* 10% project checkpoint report
* 30% final project report, presentation, artifact eval



## Grading rules

The final grade is computed according to the following rules:

* A+: >= 98%; A: \[93%, 98%); A-: \[88%, 93%)
* B+: \[83%, 87%); B: \[80%, 83%); B-: \[80%, 83%)
* C+: \[77%, 80%); C: \[73%, 77%); C-: \[70%, 73%)
* D+: \[67%, 70%); D: \[63%, 67%); D-: \[60%, 63%)
* F: < 60%
